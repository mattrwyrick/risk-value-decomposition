6. Market Volatility and Tail Risk
This category captures volatility and tail risks, which measure the likelihood of extreme market events and deviations from normal market behavior.

Market Volatility: ^VIX â€“ CBOE Vix Index, representing expected stock market volatility (often called the "fear index").
Tail Risk (Skew): Measures the asymmetry of the return distribution, indicating the likelihood of extreme negative events.
Tail Risk (Kurtosis): Measures the fat-tailedness of return distributions, indicating the likelihood of extreme deviations from the mean.
Group Name: Volatility and Tail Risk

Description: This group captures market uncertainty, extreme risk events, and the overall level of volatility. The VIX measures expected market volatility, while skewness and kurtosis capture the likelihood of rare, extreme events.
